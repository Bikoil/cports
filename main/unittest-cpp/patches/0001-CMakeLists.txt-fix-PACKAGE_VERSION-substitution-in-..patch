Subject: [PATCH] CMakeLists.txt: fix PACKAGE_VERSION substitution in .pc file

Before the change project built using `cmake` had Version field empty:

    Version:

After the change version is set as expected:

    Version: 2.1.0

Noticed as as a build failure of `echant-2.6.4` which failed to find the
package using `pkg-config --exists --print-errors "UnitTest++ >= 1.6"`
expression.
